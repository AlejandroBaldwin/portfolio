I builded this WebApp for people who wants to look up important and relevant
information about a stock.

I'm using the IEX Cloud API to gather the stock's information and ChartJS to build the chart.
This project has been revamped to have a serverless architecture based on firebase functions and firestore NoSQL database.
Using the ReactJS ecosystem (Redux, React-Router, Thunk, etc) for the client side.

This app is responsive and also a PWA, which means that you can save it on your phone (Android & iOS).

Future Features:
    -Improve SEO Friendliness
    -Different kinds of charts (Candle Sticks, Line, Bars)
    -Users Accounts
    -Favorite System
    -User suggestions!!! :D
